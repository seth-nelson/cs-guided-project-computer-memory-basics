"""
Given an unsigned integer, write a function that returns the number of '1' bits
that the integer contains (the
[Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight))

Examples:

- `hamming_weight(n = 00000000000000000000001000000011) -> 3`
- `hamming_weight(n = 00000000000000000000000000001000) -> 1`
- `hamming_weight(n = 11111111111111111111111111111011) -> 31`

Notes:

- "Unsigned Integers (often called "uints") are just like integers (whole
numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated
with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive). We use uint's
when we know the value we are counting will always be non-negative."
